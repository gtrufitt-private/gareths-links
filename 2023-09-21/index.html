<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The blog post discusses learnings from performing tech startup code audits over a period of five years, revealing that smaller engineering teams often build the most impressive products, that adopting a simple approach to engineering leads to better outcomes than complexity, and that the worst security vulnerabilities were often obvious and easy to exploit. Other insights include noting that writing secure software has become easier over the last decade due to security awareness among developers, secure-by-default features in frameworks have greatly improved security, the importance of auditing monorepos, never deserialize untrusted data, and business logic flaws are rare but potentially damaging when they occur.
