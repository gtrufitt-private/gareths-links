I have clarity on the good and bad… but to general societal mental health WFH is good. And to productivity WFH is better. Yes there’s arguments to ‘coming together’ - strong ones - but ‘in the office x days a week’ just can’t be the solution, despite big tech and their big real estate investments wanting it to be so.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The article suggests that, although employers may not be in favour of it, remote working from home (WFH) leads to happier employees. No more information is available due to the Financial Times’ paywall.
