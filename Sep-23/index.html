I have clarity on the good and bad… but to general societal mental health WFH is good. And to productivity WFH is better. Yes there’s arguments to ‘coming together’ - strong ones - but ‘in the office x days a week’ just can’t be the solution, despite big tech and their big real estate investments wanting it to be so.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The article suggests that, although employers may not be in favour of it, remote working from home (WFH) leads to happier employees. No more information is available due to the Financial Times’ paywall.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Veterinary records and a former employee dispute Elon Musk's claim that monkeys who died during Neuralink's trials were "close to death already," indicating instead that multiple monkeys suffered severe health issues and were euthanized after receiving Neuralink implants. These allegations have prompted the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine to demand an investigation from the US Securities Exchange Commission into Musk's claims, arguing that his posts on Twitter have investor implications.
