<h2><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/74b43b83-1af1-4045-9bd1-15fc8556972d">Bosses won’t like it but WFH is a happier way to work | Financial Times</a></h2><p>It’s not a particularly surprising conclusion, and I have mixed feelings of remote working having now got to the point where I’m doing it almost full time while others are in the office (not a situation I’ve been in before). I have clarity on the good and bad… but to general societal mental health WFH is good. And to productivity WFH is better. Yes there’s arguments to ‘coming together’ - strong ones - but ‘in the office x days a week’ just can’t be the solution, despite big tech and their big real estate investments wanting it to be so.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The article suggests that, although employers may not be in favour of it, remote working from home (WFH) leads to happier employees. No more information is available due to the Financial Times’ paywall.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Veterinary records and a former employee dispute Elon Musk's claim that monkeys who died during Neuralink's trials were "close to death already," indicating instead that multiple monkeys suffered severe health issues and were euthanized after receiving Neuralink implants. These allegations have prompted the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine to demand an investigation from the US Securities Exchange Commission into Musk's claims, arguing that his posts on Twitter have investor implications.

<h2><a href="https://review.firstround.com/the-engineers-guide-to-career-growth-advice-from-my-time-at-stripe-and-facebook?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=working">The Engineer’s Guide to Career Growth — Advice from My Time at Stripe and Facebook | First Round Review</a></h2>
<p>:speaking_head_in_silhouette: I found this article full of golden nuggets of advice both as a manager but for those starting their career, worth a read for engineers at any level.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
Raylene Yung, a former Facebook engineering manager and Stripe product management leader, provided career growth tips for engineers drawing from her experiences in both organizations. She noted the importance of aiming to be the most valuable yet least critical, suggesting engineers should seek to transfer knowledge to their peers to ensure problems can be solved without them, incorporate emotional equilibrium into their management style, and emphasise learning and growth over advancing quickly.

<p>:speaking_head_in_silhouette: This whole series is really good, the first three are useful for APIs, I actually saw the last one first (but recommend them all) . This article in particular, the ID prefix is interesting and then using that ID through the system, with the prefix, would be a really beneficial thing for us WRT observability?</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The article advises on effective API design specifically focusing on the structuring of object Identity numbers (IDs), arguing for the use of unique, non-predictable IDs, such as the Universally Unique Identifier, and the addition of a prefix to make IDs human readable. The use of a prefix can also facilitate debugging, prevent human error, and allow different objects and types of information to be easily differentiated and accessed in a database.

<p>:speaking_head_in_silhouette: Older article but a good one about how the BFF term was coined at Soundcloud</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
Engineers at SoundCloud experimented with different architectural structures to manage service usage and reducing overlap to increase system efficiency, ultimately settling on a pattern they called "Back-end for Front-end" (BFF). Essentially the BFF solution offers better flexibility for developers, enabling them to aggregate information better, ease pressure on the API, and reduce response time in slower, wireless networks.

<h2><a href="https://renegadeotter.com/2023/09/10/death-by-a-thousand-microservices.html">Death by a thousand microservices</a></h2>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The software industry is returning to the philosophy that overly complex systems, specifically microservices-based systems, can hinder productivity and growth. Patterns highlighted in a summary of five years of startup audits, such as collective imposter syndrome when building simple, straight-forward systems, reveal that complexity often results in waste and inefficiency, leading to companies failing to solve problems that they do not have.
</p>
<h3>Hacker News Comment Summary</h3>
<p>
The commentators express frustration over the perception of software design and architecture as outdated, while microservices and monorepos are considered relevant and significant in the industry.
